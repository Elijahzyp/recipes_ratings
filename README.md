# recipes_ratings

### Introduction and Question Identification
​		Our original datasets are two files, recipes and ratings, scraped from food.com. But we merged two datasets to calculate the average rating for each recipe and merge it back to recipes dataset to give each recipe an average rating. Hence, the final dataset we will work with is the orginal recipes dataset with average rating. 

​		For our questions, we wanted to explore the nutrition data of each recipe. To do so, we want to explore the relationships between the healthiness of a recipe and its average rating.

We decide to choose: 
> **Does people post about healthier recipes now compared to the past?**

as our question for this project.
